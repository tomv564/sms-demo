46Elks api:

From field not clear (can it be text?)

Optional field for .. delivery should be at the end?

Delivery on a wrong url (returned 405), cannot save cleared url and correction does not seem to be picked up?


Windows development - as usual.


Getting an xbuild:

install nuget (including dll) to /usr/local/bin, handy sh script gist.
no solution-wide packages.config, so run on each project that needs it. (see restore.sh)
remove non-buildable projects (eg. Visual studio mstest projects) from SLN

then run: mono SMSServer/bin/Debug/SMSServer.exe

Set up application:

ssh into your dokku box (or use heroku commands)
run dokku apps:create sms.tomv.io

dokku config:set sms.tomv.io BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/friism/heroku-buildpack-mono/

https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks/adamburgess/heroku-buildpack-mono

get a newer buildpack.

Make sure it's running on a decent port (dokku wants 5000 but also specifies 5000, there is no HOST parameter unless you create it yourself)

Push:

git remote add dokku dokku@igelkott:sms.tomv.io
git push dokku master
