From field not clear (can it be text?)

Optional field for .. delivery should be at the end?

Delivery on a wrong url (returned 405), cannot clear url and correction does not seem to be picked up?

Windows development - as usual.


Getting an xbuild:

install nuget (including dll) to /usr/local/bin, handy sh script gist.
no solution-wide packages.config, so run on each project that needs it. (see restore.sh)
remove non-buildable projects (eg. Visual studio mstest projects) from SLN

then run: mono SMSServer/bin/Debug/SMSServer.exe
